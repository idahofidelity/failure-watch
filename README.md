# 🦅 US Industrial Incident Tracker
**Idaho Fidelity Foundation**  
Live tracker: `https://idahofidelity.github.io/incident-tracker`

---

## What This Is
Interactive US map tracking 6 years of industrial incidents — chemical plants, oil refineries, pipelines, rail tankers, petrochemical storage, and water treatment facilities. Incidents are color-coded by **cause** (accidental, intentional, under investigation, natural, unknown) and shaped by **facility type**. Each incident links to top neutral news articles scored by AI for factual bias.

Cross-referenced against:
- **CSB** (Chemical Safety Board — federal, neutral)
- **EPA RMP** (Risk Management Plan filings — federal, neutral)
- **SpillTracker.org** (Bloomberg-funded activist tracker — noted for framing bias)
- **Coalition to Prevent Chemical Disasters** (environmental NGO)

## Adding New Incidents
Edit `data/incidents.js`. Copy an existing entry and update all fields:

```javascript
{
  id: "inc_031",               // unique, sequential
  name: "Full Incident Name",
  date: "2025-06-01",          // YYYY-MM-DD
  lat: 29.76,                  // decimal coordinates
  lng: -95.36,
  city: "Houston",
  state: "TX",
  facility_type: "oil_refinery", // see options below
  cause: "accidental",           // see options below
  cause_detail: "Detailed cause description",
  severity: "major",             // catastrophic | major | moderate
  injuries: 0,
  fatalities: 0,
  evacuations: 0,
  description: "Full narrative description.",
  csb_investigated: false,
  spilltracker_listed: false,
  coalition_listed: false,
  epa_rmp: false,
},
```

**facility_type options:** `oil_refinery` | `chemical_plant` | `pipeline` | `rail_tanker` | `petrochemical_storage` | `water_treatment`

**cause options:** `accidental` | `intentional` | `under_investigation` | `natural_cause` | `unknown`

## API Usage Notes
- **GNews** free tier = 100 requests/day. Articles are cached per session so each incident only queries once.
- **Anthropic** API is called once per incident to score article neutrality. Cached in session memory.
- Both keys are client-side in `config.js`. For a public production site, consider a lightweight proxy to protect keys.
